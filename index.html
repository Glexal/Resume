            <p>Send Me Missions is a nonprofit Christian organization dedicated to serving the
                community locally by “uniting the Body of Christ to serve as one body as the church”.
                During my time with Send Me Missions I worked in disaster relief after the events of
                Hurricane Ian. A few of the responsibilities I had while working with SMM during that
                time were clearing debris, cleaning of houses that had suffered damage from the
                hurricane. I also moved furniture and supplies between SMM storage facilities and to the
                homes of families.</p>

            <p>Lift Disability Network is a nonprofit organization dedicated to “Elevating life in the
                disability family”, they do this in part through a weeklong camp by the name of Camp
                Breakaway. Camp Breakaway is a camp where families who are affected by disabilities
                can enjoy a week of activities and relaxation. Every camper is assigned a volunteer or
                “buddy” to accompany them in their parent/guardian. The volunteers assigned to
                campers accompany their assigned individual the entire week to make sure they can
                have as good a week as possible during the week’s activities. I worked as a buddy for
                three years.</p>
